                 <h2>COMPUTER SECURITY</h2>


                 <p>
                     In this era of “cyber terrorism,” computer viruses, and international spying by distant hackers, it is clear that computer security is a topic of concern in the field of computer ethics. The problem is not much the physical security of hardware (i.e. protecting it from theft, fire, flood etc), but rather “Logical security, which Spafford divided into five aspects:
<br />1.	Privacy and confidentiality
<br />2.	Integrity – assuring that data and programs are not modified without proper authority
<br />3.	Unimpaired service
<br />4.	Consistency – ensuring that the data and behavior we see today will be the same tomorrow
<br />5.	Controlling access to resources

<br /> <strong> Malicious software, or programmed threats’,</strong> provide a significant challenge to computer security. These include:
<br />•	<strong> Viruse</strong> -which cannot run on their own, but rather are inserted into other computer programs.
<br />•<strong>	Worm</strong> - Which can move from machine to machine across networks, and may have parts of themselves running on different machines
<br />• <strong>Trojan horses</strong> – Which give the appearance of being one sort of program, but actually are doing damage behind the scenes. 
<br />•	<strong> Logic bombs</strong> – Which check for particular conditions and then execute when those conditions arise.
<br />• <strong>	Bacteria or rabbits </strong>- which multiply rapidly and fill up the computer’s memory.

<br />We focus here on policy issues relating to computer and communication security and on the roles that technology can and cannot play in enforcing the desired policies. In the present context, computer security relates to measures to provide desired confidentiality, integrity, availability and more generally, prevention against misuse, accident and malfunction, with respect to both computer systems and the information they contain. We deliberately take a broad view of what might constitute computer security as encompassing the prevention of undesirable events, and take a broad view of undesirable human activities as well.

<br /> <strong> Security </strong>is intrinsically a double-edge in computers and communications: it cuts both ways. For example:
<br />•	It can be used to protect personal privacy.
<br />•	It can be used to undermine freedom of access to false information about an individual to which that person should be entitled access: it can also be used to undermine other personal rights.
<br />•	It can help defend against malicious misuse, such as penetrations, Trojan horses, viruses and other forma of tampering. 
<br />•	It can significantly hinder urgent repairs and responses to emergencies.
<br />•	It can greatly simplify the concerns of legitimate users.
<br />•It can seriously impair the abilities of legitimate users attempting to protect themselves from calamities, particularly in poorly designed systems with the ill conceived human interfaces; it can also hinder routine system use.  
<br />•	Automated monitoring of computer activities can be used to detect intruders, masqueraders, misuse, and other undesirable events.
<br />•	Automated monitoring of computer activities can be used to spy on legitimated users, seriously undermining personal privacy

                 <h2> THE MAJOR SECURITY THREATS TO IT SYSTEMS </h2>
               <p>  <strong>  The threats within the business are:</strong></p>
                 <h2>	FIRE</h2>

<p> <strong> Fire </strong> is the most serious threat. The destruction and loss of company data can be more costly that the destruction of hardware components.</p>
<hr />
	<h2> WATER/FLOOD</h2>

  <p> <strong> Water </strong>is another very serious threat. Flooding and water damage can be caused by burst pipes, leakages, etc, but more often than not a building can have this sort of damage incurred after fire in other areas necessitating the need for excessive use of water. Greater risks exist in coastal areas as well as in the lower areas such as basements within a building.</p>
<hr />
<h2>	WEATHER CAN BE A THREAT</h2>

 <p>Flooding, monsoon rains, hurricanes, tornadoes can all pose severe threat to computer systems. Poorly maintained and prefabricated buildings are particularly vulnerable.</p>
                 <hr />
	 <h2>LIGHTING AND ELECTRICAL STORMS</h2>

<p>These can cause major problems with power supply to buildings resulting in electrical surges, spiking, etc.</p>
                 <hr />
<h2>	PHYSICAL ACCESS TO COMPUTER EQUIPMENT</h2>

<p>Poorly secured rooms, unrestricted access and poor control over the issue of keys can also pose a serious physical security risk to data.</p>
                 <hr />
	<h2> THREAT OF THEFT</h2>

<p>Computer equipment becoming more portable has increased the opportunity for theft to increase. Thefts can be by internal staff or from break-in.</p>
                 <hr />
<h2>	THE THREAT OF UNCONTROLLED ACCESS TO SYSTEMS SOFTWARE</h2>

<p>Passwords are widely used but are often misused. People often choose easy passwords, eg, favourite football teams. Passwords are given away by shouting them to colleagues, or writing them down. Extended use of the same password breeds laziness.</p>
                 <hr />

<h2>	THE THREAT OF FRAUD AND SABOTAGE</h2>

<p>These can be carried out by unhappy staffs that deliberately destroy data for no good reason. At other times, important information can be sold to competitors. Hackers are individuals (often very skilled in programming) who gain access to organizational computer) systems without authority. Their intention may be to disrupt business operations by affecting data. It is also possible that fraud and sabotage can be carried out by programming staff.</p>
                 <hr />
	<h2>ACCESS AFTER MAJOR INCIDENTS</h2>

   <p>Often after major incidents such as fire or terrorist attack, access to buildings can pose a serious problem to the organisation. Even in cases where computer equipment’s not damaged, serious disruption can take place by not being able to enter buildings to continue normal organisational operation.</p>



                 <hr />
                 <h2>DISASTER RECOVERY</h2>
                 <p> <strong> The following solutions are put forward in response to the threats listed above:</strong></p>

	<h2>PHYSICAL THREATS</h2>

<p><br />a) <strong>	Fire Safety Plan</strong>
<br />•	Site preparation. The building material used for the computer room and storage devices area must be fire resistant or retardant.
<br />•	Smoke detection equipment should be installed.
<br />•	Fire alarms to be used in the emergency.
<br />•	Automatic sprinklers installed in areas where fires are likely to start.
<br />•	Staff must be trained to use fire extinguishers.
<br />•	Computer files should be kept locked in fire proof cabinets.
<br />•	Computer rooms should have fire extinguishers.</p>


<p><br />b)	<strong> Water</strong>
<br />There should be adequate drainage for water to escape the building. Avoid the use of basements for computer equipment sitting. Leaking roofs, plumbing, and air conditioning have caused far more damage than any hacker. This threat should be considered during the design stage of a structure.
    </p>

<p><br />c)	<strong> Weather</strong>
<br />Sometimes the weather can cause havoc and damage office buildings. Appropriate building construction and maintenance is required for computer rooms. In a storm, blackouts, brownouts and power surges are responsible for data loss. Use of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems and backup diesel generators can help to counter this threat. Critical areas in business that may use backup generators are banks, airline seat reservation, sales order processing, etc.
    </p>
<p><br />d) <strong>	  Computer Environment</strong>
<br />Computer equipment can be affected even by the smallest amount of moisture. Temperatures and dust must be controlled by installing air-conditioners. To protect micros from possible moisture damage, plastic covers (which also provide dust protection) should be used.
</p>
<p><br />e)	<strong> The Threat of Theft</strong>
<br />An up to date log of all computer equipment and accessories should be maintained. All the equipment should be securely locked, and where possible certain staff should have limited access to restricted areas.
    </p>
<p>Microcomputers and their components cause a significant problem to organisations. Some of the components are easy o carry away in a purse, briefcase, or coat pocket. A hardware solution – locks, chains, desks mounts are used to help ensure the equipment does not grow legs and take vital company information with it. Organisations should maintain accurate or current inventories of their microcomputer components and peripherals by ensuring that serial numbers are recorded.
    </p>
                 <hr />
	<h2> Threat of Uncontrolled Access to System Software></h2>
<p><br /> <strong> The following measures can be taken:</strong>
<br />•	Frequent backup of information and software.
<br />•	Security passwords – permits only personnel with passwords to use computers. Passwords should be changed regularly.
<br />•	Lockable fire safes for data disk, installing door locks to computer room. Magnetic cards can be used at doors to gain access entry into the computer room.
<br />•	Terminals should not be left unattended.
<br />•	Access to application programs/software should be adequately restricted.
    </p>
	<h2> threat of Fraud and Sabotageh2></h2>
<p><br />It is important to keep system access logs. Whoever accesses the system, the date, time and identification of user must be recorded on a computer file within the system. The log should also record what information is being accessed. Regularly the logs should be monitored so that unusual activities can be immediately investigated.

<br />Again different users of the systems can be given different levels of permission. For example, an accountant can have access right to enter data, but cannot make any changes to the records. The privilege to alter records, such as prices, may be given to the senior accountant. Other users have permission to view records only on the screen or print them.

<br />When a user wants to have access to company sensitive information, he or she must first be cleared by personnel in charge of the data. This will reduce risks associated with system penetration by outsiders (hackers, etc).
</p>
                 <hr /> 
  <h2> SECURITY PLANNING</h2>

<p>Why is it important to plan for disaster? A disaster recovery /contingency plan helps an organisation to respond to the variety of events that can affect its operations. It describes the steps an organisation would take to restore computer operations in the event of a disaster.
    </p>
<p>This plan must be understood and communicated to all the personnel concerned. The plan should have a ‘short term plan’ to deal with minor disruptions. A long term plan will be for more serious problems and should include contingencies for:
    </p>
<p><br />•	What hardware is to be used?
<br />.•	What software is to be used?
<br />•	How is the data to be recovered?
<br />•	The off-site backup information
<br />•	Details of key personnel who are in the recovery plan.
    </p>
    <hr />
 <h2 >A typical plan will include:</h2>

	<h2>  Definition of responsibilities</h2>
<p>Names of personnel responsible for specific tasks are identified. For example, someone will be given a task of checking viruses on the system; another will be responsible for backups, etc.
    </p>
	<h2> Establishment of priorities.</h2>
 <p> Depending on the nature of what has been affected, eg, hardware or software, each resource will be graded in terms of importance to receive first attention.
     </p>
	<h2> Backup and standby arrangements</h2>
 <p>  This will specify how backing up files will be carried out. In the event of restarting operations equipment used to resume processing will be identified. Standby arrangements may be a second computer system to be used in an emergency.
     </p>
<h2>	Staff Communication></h2>
<p>Procedures to be followed to inform staff o vacate the premises, etc.
<br/>.	Public Relations.
<br />.	Risk assessment

    </p>
