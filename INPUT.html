    <h2>   Input Device</h2>

  
                 <p>An <strong> Input Device </strong>converts data and programs that humans can understand into a form the computer can process. Such a device translates the letters, numbers, and other natural-language symbols that humans conventionally use in reading and writing into the configurations of 0 and 1 bits that the computer processes.
</p>
<hr />
  <h2>1.	Keyboards:</h2>

  <p> The <strong> Keyboard </strong>is an input device composed of numerous keys, arranged in a configuration similar to that of a typewriter, that generate letters, numbers, and other symbols when depressed.

Most computers would be useless without keyboards. Keyboards are the main devices through which computers receive user input. The large majority of keyboards follow a standard arrangement for letter keys called “QWERTY” (named for the first six letter keys at the top-left of most typewriter keyboards).

The number of special keys, as well as their capabilities and placement, varies among manufacturers. When buying a computer system, one has to look carefully at the keyboard’s key selection and the placement of keys.
      </p>
                 <hr />
  <h2 > 2.	Pointing Devices:</h2>

 <p>  <strong >Pointing devices</strong> refer to input hardware that moves an onscreen pointer such as an arrow, cursor, or insertion point. As the pointing device is moved along a surface or, alternatively, as it remains stationary while a finger or hand operates it, the pointing device determines position, distance, or speed and repositions the onscreen pointer accordingly.

Seven common types of pointing devices are the mouse, light pen, touch screen, joystick, trackball, crosshair cursor, and graphics tablet.
</p>  
                 <hr />


 <h2>   3.	Mouse:</h2>

 <p>  This is a common pointing device that you slide along a flat surface to move a pointer around a display screen and make selections. Many people supplement keyboard input with a mouse. When you move the mouse along a flat surface, the onscreen pointer – often referred to as a mouse pointer – moves correspondingly. Mice provide capabilities to move rapidly from one location to another on a display screen, to make screen selections, to move and resize screen images, and to draw on the screen. A mouse often accomplishes such tasks much faster or far more effectively than you could complete them by pressing combinations of keys on the keyboard.

Mice are especially handy tools for working with icons on the screen. Icons are small graphics symbols that represent commands or program options. When you use the mouse to select an icon, you point to it on the screen and press – or click – the left mouse button once or twice. To move an icon from one part of the screen to another, you position the mouse pointer on the icon, hold down the button while moving the mouse to drag the icon to its new position, and release the mouse button. This operation is commonly known as dragging and dropping.

While most mice sold with computer systems connect via serial cables to a computer’s system unit, cordless mice are also available. These mice, powered by batteries, send wireless signals to which the computer responds.
</p>
                 <hr />

 <h2> (4)	Light Pen:</h2>

<p>A <strong > light pen</strong> is an electrical device, resembling an ordinary pen, used to enter computer input. A light pen senses marks or other indicators through a light-sensitive cell in its tip. When the tip of the pen is placed close to the screen, the display device can identify its position. Some pens are equipped with buttons that users press to flip stored pages forward or backward on the screen, and many come with their own command sets. Potential users of portable computers equipped with light pens include inspectors, factory workers, sales representatives, real-estate agents, police officers, doctors and nurses, insurance adjusters, store clerks, and truck drivers – in other words, anybody that regularly carries around a clipboard and has forms to fill out.
    </p>
                 <hr />
   <h2>(5)	Touch-Screen Display:</h2>

<p> This is a display device that generates input when you touch a finger to the screen. This particular device is designed to allow a finger rather than a light pen to activate onscreen commands. Touch screens are widely employed today in information kiosks, which are often used by people who are not computer literate. These input devices are also useful for factory applications and fieldwork, where users wear gloves or cannot operate input devices for other reasons.
    </p>
                 <hr />
<h2>(6)	Joystick:</h2>

<p>This is an input device that resembles a car’s gearshift. This input device often supports computer games and computer aided design (CAD) work. The speed at which the joystick is manipulated and the distance it travels determine the screen pointer’s movement. Today, some electronic games replace joysticks with gloves containing built-in sensors, enabling the computer to detect hand movements directly.
</p>
                 <hr />
<h2>(7)	Trackball:</h2>

<p>  This is an input device that exposes the top of a sphere, which the user moves to control an onscreen pointer.
     A trackball consists of a sphere with its top exposed through a case. The onscreen pointer travels in the same direction as the operator spins the sphere. In fact, a trackball is merely a mouse turned upside down. Recently, a number of devices have come on the market to compete with the traditional trackball and mouse.
</p>
                 <hr />

	<h2> The Pointing Stick</h2> 
                <p>  This is a small keyboard stick found on many notebook computers, that you push in different directions to move the onscreen pointer. The pointing stick is ideal when trackball-like functionality is needed and it is inconvenient to carry around or use a conventional trackball.
                    </p>

	<h2> A Touchpad </h2>
                  <p >This is a pressure and motion sensitive input device. It uses a pointing strategy that follows a finger’s motion across a small surface to move the pointer around the screen.
</p>

                 <hr />
<h2> (8)	Crosshair Cursor:</h2>

 <p> This is an input device that you move over hard-copy images of maps, survey photos and drawings to enter them into computer storage. The image is recorded into the computer system’s memory as the device passes over it. Using a keypad on the device, you can enter supplementary information into the memory. While scanning maps, for example, you can indicate features such as rivers, roads and buildings by carefully positioning the crosshair and keying in any identifying labels from the keypad. After recording the maps in digital form, you can call them up for display on the screen and modify them.
     </p>
                 <hr />
<h2> (9)	Graphics Tablet:</h2>

 <p> This is an input device that consists of a flat board and a pointing mechanism that traces over it, storing the traced pattern in computer memory. A graphics tablet, which is also known as a digitising tablet, usually employs either a crosshair cursor or penlike stylus. Using one or the other, you can trace over a drawing placed on the flat, touch-sensitive tablet. You can think of the tablet as a matrix of thousands of tiny dots, each with its own machine address. When you trace a line on the tablet, the stylus or cursor passes over some of the dots, causing their status in computer memory to change from a 0 state to a 1 state. When the drawing is complete, it is stored in digital form as a large matrix of 0s and 1s; you can then recall it at any time.
     </p>
<hr />
	<h2>  Source Data Automation Devices:</h2>

 <p > <strong> Source data automation</strong> is the process of collecting data at their point of origin in digital form.

Applications often require translation of handwritten data into digital form that allows electronic processing. This procedure sometimes consumes thousands of hours of wasteful, duplicated effort, and it can result in many mistakes and delays. Data originally recorded by hand onto source documents or forms must then be keyed into digital form on some input device, verified and read into the computer. Usually, several people must cooperate in such a process, complicating matters further.

Source data automation eliminates much of this duplicated effort, delay, extra handling and potential for error by initially collecting data in digital form, which is ready-to-process transaction data.

     </p>
<hr />

   <h2> Here are some input technologies and devices that contribute to source data automation:</h2>

<h2>   (a)	Optical Character Recognition (OCR):</h2>

  <p > <strong> Optical Character Recognition</strong> method is the use of reflected light to input marks, characters or codes into computer memory.

OCR technology encompasses a wide range of optical-scanning procedures and equipment designed for machine recognition of marks, characters and codes. OCR devices transform symbols into digital data for storage in the computer.
</p>
<hr />
  <h2> i.	Optical Marks:</h2>
                 <p> The mark reading devices recognise the presence of a mark photoelectrically. The mark is detected by reflected light. These devices are reasonably tolerant, but doubtful marks can be kept to a minimum if paper and markings are of uniform quality within an installation, and kept clear of folds in the paper.

One of the oldest applications of OCR focuses on processing tests and questionnaires completed on special forms using optical marks. For example, a student darkens the bubbles on an answer sheet to indicate the answers to multiple-choice test questions. A hardware device called an optical document reader scans the answer sheets offline by passing a light beam across the spaces corresponding to the sets of possible responses to the questions. Filled-in responses reflect the light, and the machine tallies that choice. Results are compiled on a disk or tape cartridge for processing by a computer system. The other area of application is in Stock Record Cards reading.
                 </p>
  <h2> This system has a number of advantages:</h2>
<p > <br />(a)	The sensing mechanism is fairly cheap;
<br />(b)	The marks can be made mechanically so that the document can be part of a turnaround system;
<br />(c)	Where the marks are made clerically, the intermediate stage of keypunching is eliminated.
    </p>
                 <hr />
   <h2 > ii.	Optical Characters:</h2>
                 <p> These are characters specially designed to be identifiable by humans as well as by some type of OCR reader. Optical characters conform to a certain font design. The optical reader shines light on the characters and converts the reflections into electronic patterns for machine recognition. The reader can identify a character only if it is familiar with the font standard used. Optical characters are widely used in processing turnaround documents, such as the credit-card slips used for customer transactions in stores and restaurants.

Good examples of documents suited for optical character readers are gas and electricity bills. 
                     The bills are printed with all the information necessary for re-input to the system in an OCR font.

The principles have been extended and can now accommodate careful hand printing but not script. This equipment overcomes some of the limitations of mark recognition but at an increased price.
</p>
<hr />

<h2>  iii.	Optical Codes:</h2>
                <p > The most widely used type of optical code is the Bar code.
                  A <strong > bar code</strong> is a machine-readable code that stores data as sets of several vertical bars of varying widths. The code supplies data on a product or transaction when the system reads it, either by the operator passing a scanning wand or gun over the coded label or moving the item past a fixed scanning station.

The most familiar bar code is the Universal Product Code (UPC) commonly found on packaged goods in supermarkets and in use since the early 1970s. Each code describes a product and identifies its manufacturer. The checkout system’s bar-code reader gathers data that allows computers to identify the item, look up the latest price, and print the information on a receipt. Most bar-code readers employ a gun, wand or scanning station.

  <br />A gun is a scanning device usually used with cash-register terminals in many types of retailing environments, whereas a wand is also a lightweight scanning device, particularly handy when the operator has to do scanning while on the move. A Scanning Station is the type of reader found most in supermarkets.

While supermarket packaging probably represents the most common use of bar codes, codes similar to the UPC support a variety of other applications. For instance, hospitals use bar codes to identify patient samples, and the police use bar codes to mark evidence.
</p>
                 <hr />
  <h2>  (b) 	Point-of-Sale Systems (POS):</h2>

 <p> A <strong> Point-of-Sale System</strong> is a computer system, commonly found in department stores and supermarkets, that uses electronic cash register terminals to collect, process and store data about sales transactions.

  <br />The Point-of-Sale terminal is essentially an electronic cash register which is linked to a computer, or which records data onto cassette or cartridge. In its simplest form, it may simply transmit the details of a transaction to the computer for processing.

<br />The more complex terminals can communicate with the computer for such purposes as checking the credit position of a Customer, obtaining prices from a file and ascertaining availability of stock. The terminal usually includes a keyboard for manual entry of data. A bar-code reader such as a scanning gun may also be provided, typically to read stock codes. Other specialised devices that the terminal may also control include: 
<br />i.	Wand Reader, a handheld device for reading bar-codes or printed characters direct from the merchandise;
<br />ii.	A Credit Card Reader;
<br />iii.	A Kimball Tag Reader.
<br />When the store clerk reads the label attached to each purchased item with a hand scanner connected to the sales register, a computer within the register performs all of the necessary arithmetic, prepares a customer receipt and accumulates input for subsequent management analysis.
     
<b />Examples of point-of-sale (POS) systems are retail-based bar-coding systems that use special terminals as described above, to verify customer credit, compute sale taxes on transactions, and record transaction data such as product descriptions and sales amounts. Not all POS systems however, use bar codes; for example, those at restaurants and hotels often work exclusively with the magnetic strips on credit cards, supplemented with keyboard input.
     </p>
                 <hr />
 <h2>  (c)	Image Scanners:</h2>

   <p> An <strong> Image Scanner</strong> is a device that can read into computer memory a hard-copy image such as a text page, photograph, map, or drawing.
                 <br /> Image scanners convert flat images such as photographs, drawings and documents into digital data.
                <br />  After storing the images in the computer system, you can manipulate them as you like and then drop them into slides, a desktop-published document, or another type of output.
                <br />    Scanners work in a variety of ways:
       
<br />  <strong>	Flatbed Scanner:></strong> This Scanner inputs a page at a time and works a lot like a photocopier. Many models scan colour documents and some even have attachments for capturing image data from 35mm slides.
<br /><strong > ii.	Drum Scanner:</strong> This Scanner functions in ways similar to a flatbed scanner, with a few important differences. For instance, it accepts source materials differently; a roller mechanism grasps and carries inputs fed through a narrow slot. This design cuts the scanner’s cost, the amount of desk space required, and makes sheet feeding easy. However, the feature also generally prevents the device from scanning bound-book pages.
<br /> <strong> iii.	Handheld Scanner:</strong> This type of scanners are useful for inputting small amounts of data and cost less than other types of scanners, but they also provide the most limited capabilities.
<br /><strong> iv.	OCR-capable Scanner: </strong>This kind of scanner is classed an “intelligent” image scanner and is accompanied by optical character recognition (OCR) software, which enables the scanner to recognise as well as read most standard text characters. Thus, this type of scanner can produce text that can later be edited through a standard word processing program. Image Scanners labelled “dumb” devices cannot recognise any of the text they read.
       
 <br /> Many Image Scanners that work with PCs scan at resolution rates of 300 or 600 dots per inch (dpi). As you might expect, a higher number of dots generates better resolution when the image is finally output. But keep in mind though that, an output device ultimately determines image resolution. So, it may not make sense to buy a 600 dpi scanner if your printer can’t produce hard copy sharper than 300 dpi.  

<br />Scanners can cost anywhere from a hundred to a few thousand dollars, and professional-level models can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
</p>
                 <hr />

  <h2>(d)	Digital Cameras:</h2>

  <p >A  <strong> digital camera</strong> is one that records pictures as digital data instead of film images. These cameras are much like regular cameras, but instead of recording images on print or slide film they record onto removable memory cards like those used in notebook computers. As snapshots are taken, the cards are loaded with the digital data that forms the picture image.

 <br /> Digital cameras targeted for consumers, use storage media that hold from 16 to 100 or more images. The number held depends both on the capacity of the medium and the image resolution you select. Many cameras will let you preview an image after you take it so that you can immediately erase it if it is not suitable. Once the card is full, the camera is connected to a port on the PC via a special cable. The software that comes with the camera then allows the transfer of images to the PC'’ RAM. At this stage, the software clears the card'’ memory to allow for more pictures to be taken at a later time. After storing the images on the PC'’ hard disk, they can be retouched with image-enhancement software, adjusting contrast, brightness, colour and focus, or adding special effects such as sepia tones or psychedelic colours.
<br />Digital cameras for consumer use cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 or so, and professional-level digital cameras can cost well over $10,000. Despite their hefty sticker prices, even professional digital cameras cannot match the quality of images produced by a conventional, 35 mm film camera that sells for several hundred dollars.

 <br /><strong> Disadvantages notwithstanding,</strong>
     <br />  digital cameras can produce respectable images that make them useful for most types of business and recreational applications. For instance, a news photographer often needs to capture an image immediately and send it over phone wires to an anxious editor. Two compelling advantages to digital cameras are that:
<br />i.	You need not develop film;
<br />ii.	You don’t need a scanner to get images into the computer.
</p>
<hr />

   <h2> Other Technologies:</h2>

 <p > Many other technologies in addition to the ones covered above do exist for source data automation, as follows:
</p>
                 <hr />
  <h2>   (a)	Voice-Input Devices:</h2>

 <p> These are pieces of hardware that can convert spoken words into digital data. They are capable of recognising the human voice. Many voice-input devices are designed to screen out background noises and to accept “training” from users, who repeat words until the machines recognise the patterns in their voices. Unfortunately, most voice-input devices can recognise only limited numbers of isolated words and often not whole sentences composed of continuous speech. Thus, they can respond to messages of only limited complexity. You can buy a system that can recognise 60,000 words for less than $400.

Computer systems that both accept voice input and generate spoken output are already in use.
     </p>
                  
<h2> (b)	Handwriting Recognition Devices:</h2>

<p> devices can identify handwritten characters. They often collect data through a flat-screen display tablet and a penlike stylus. In theory, as users write words and numbers on the tablet, the devices recognise this input. In practice however, handwriting recognition is still in the pioneering stage and most systems available today can recognise only hand-printed characters and with difficulty.
    </p>



  <h2> (c)	Smart Cards:</h2>

<p>  <strong > Smart cards</strong> are credit-card-sized pieces of plastic with storage (memory circuits) and a microprocessor chip. The memory capacity may be as small as a few thousand characters or as large as a few million. Smart cards serve most often as electronic payment systems for retail purchases and to transfer funds between bank accounts.

<br />The VISA SuperSmart Card contains a keyboard and tiny display to complement its CPU and memory.

Although smart cards remain largely in the pioneering stage, uses for them abound. A university might issue such cards to allow students access to their own grade or financial data. Smart cards also could be useful for making phone calls; a cardholder would have an electronic record of all phone calls made right on the card – useful for tax and billing purposes. In security applications, such a card could carry a digitised version of a fingerprint or voice and serve as an electronic passkey, allowing an authorised user access to restricted areas or a sensitive computer network. A new twist on the smart-card concept is the Smart-purse.
</p>
                 <hr />
<h2> (d)	Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR):</h2>

  <p>   <strong> MICR</strong>  is a banking-industry technology that supports high-volume processing of cheques by sensing special characters inscribed in magnetic ink. 

The standard font adopted by the industry contains only 14 characters – the ten decimal digits (0 through 9) and four (4) special symbols. MICR characters are inscribed on cheques with magnetic ink by a special machine. As people write and cash cheques, the recipients deposit them in the banking system. At banks, Reader/Sorter Machines magnetically sense and identify MICR-encoded characters. Such a system sorts and records cheques so that they can be routed to the proper banks for payment. A MICR Reader/Sorter Machine is a high-speed device capable of processing cheques in the range of 2,400 per minute. The amount of information that can be contained on each document is limited and it can only be located in special pre-determined positions.

In these systems, characters are printed in an ink, which can be magnetised so that, after being subjected to a magnetic field, they can be read and decoded. The first major use of MICR was in the banks in the United States, where a font called E13B was adopted. The system was subsequently imported into the United Kingdom banks.

The reading station is used to sense and identify the magnetic characters as they pass through. When the characters enter the magnetic ink character reader, they are magnetised by the write-head. As the magnetised characters pass through the reading head, they induce electrical signals in it that are used to identify the characters. Because each character has a rigidly defined shape, the signals produced in the read head are unique and can be easily coded into a form suitable for transmission to the computer.
</p>
                 <hr />
 <h2 > 4.	Consoles:</h2>

 <p> A  <strong> console </strong>is a man-machine communication device. It is the equipment used for communication between computer Operators and the system. It is an interactive device as it is linking the Operator directly with the computer. It is an input/output device, which allows a response to be sent by the computer to the point at which the data originated. This is a “conversational” mode, giving immediate acknowledgement to the user, together with prompts and comments on any errors.

<br />A computer console is locally connected to a computer by means of a cable and remotely connected through a circuit line.
     </p>
<hr />
   <h2> 5.	Tag Readers:</h2>

 <p>  These are the second type of POS devices, often used along with an electronic cash register. Many retail clothing stores use tag-reader systems. Clothes have price tags coded with circular punched holes that give the inventory item number and price information. The tag is similar to a punched card in that a reading device must read and interpret it. When the tag-reading device is clamped onto the tag, it interprets the data contained in the pattern of holes and reads this data into the computer system, which uses it to prepare the sales slip and update inventory records.

A different kind of tag-reader system is similar in function but has data implanted on a strip of magnetisable material on the tag. Magnetic-strip tags must be placed in a special type of code-reading device.
     </p>

<h2> 6.	Key-to-Tape and Key-to-Disk Systems</h2>
 
  <p >  key-to-tape technology and key-to-disk technology, which together have become the dominant input methodology during the last decade, are different but related technologies. The choice between the two is based largely on cost as key-to-tape systems are less expensive, or on a need for the additional capabilities which key-to-disk systems can provide.


While the key-to-tape and key-to-disk systems use standard tape and hard disk technology, less expensive systems using key to cassette tape and key to floppy disk are also available. Appropriate for low-volume data input, these low-budget systems are inefficient for an environment in which multiple terminals are inputting data to the key-to-tape or key-to-disk system and in which, transactions entry is a continuous daily activity. 

Whereas cassette-tape and floppy disk systems would be likely to have few workstations or only one, standard tape and hard disk systems usually would have several, within a single system.

      </p>
                 <hr />

 <h2> (a)	Key-to-Tape Systems:</h2>

<p > Source data is keyed directly onto magnetic tape from a source document. This involves the use of a machine called a Magnetic Tape Encoder. The machine consists of a keyboard, a small electronic memory (buffer), and a reel of magnetic tape, which is removable.

Data from the source document is keyed by an Operator onto tape reel via the Encoder’s memory. Before passing from memory to the tape, limited validity checks are carried out, e.g. if the Operator is keying-in a “name” field, the machine under the direction of a stored program, will not accept a numeric character and vice versa, etc.

When a batch of documents has been encoded onto tape, verification follows. This is done by re-loading the tape and switching the encoder to “verify” status. The keying-in process is repeated and the machine under the control of the stored program carries out a comparison with the data already on the tape. The machine stops if an error is detected. Errors can be corrected there and then by overwriting the incorrect data on the tape. A different Operator usually performs the verification process. This form of verification, because it employs double input and computer-based comparison, offers greater assurance that errors will not occur during data input, but it is more time-consuming. Nonetheless, where strict accuracy is a major concern, this verification approach is preferred.

The second verification method is used where entry speed is more important than absolute accuracy. With this method, the transaction in buffer memory is displayed automatically on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), which is located at the input terminal; the transaction then is scanned and reviewed by the terminal Operator. If the transaction is correct, an ENTRY key is activated, which transfers the transaction from buffer memory to magnetic tape. If an error has been made, the same Operator corrects the transaction on the same terminal and once more verifies the transaction.

Each encoder is equipped with one tape reel, and the reels from a number of encoders are pooled (or merged onto one reel). The merged reel is then used as input to the computer.

 <br />A key-to-tape system is more economical than a key-to-disk system. However, it offers no means of sorting the transactions of the tape without using additional equipment. Transactions often need to be sorted. 
Where a key-to-tape system is used without additional equipment, the taped transactions must be sorted internally by the main computer system, which consumes valuable CPU time. In addition to this problem, a key-to-tape system lacks certain capabilities of a key-to-disk system.
    </p>
                 <hr />


   <h2>(b)	Key-to-Disk Systems:</h2>

  <p> In a  <strong> key-to-disk system,</strong> the input and verification processes are similar to those of a key-to-tape system, with the important differences that disk rather than tape technology is used and the transactions are entered onto a disk in a disk-drive unit. 

Data from a source document is keyed in at a key station by an Operator. Data is automatically formatted and stored on the disc under the control of a program in the processor. Verification is done by a different Operator who keys in the same data from the source documents. This is compared with the data already residing on disk and errors can be corrected there and then. Data to be verified is identified by batch numbers.

A major advantage of a key-to-disk system is the ability to sort transactions on disk. Another type of sorting allows the merging of two or more disks from different key-to-disk systems before entry to the computer system.

Key-to-disk systems also permit convenient alteration of a transaction already entered on the disk. For example, if a telephone sales transaction has been received by a terminal operator and entered onto the disk and a few minutes later the customer calls back to change or cancel the order, a key-to-tape system must treat the second call as a separate transaction. With a key-to-disk system, it is possible without undue effort to key in the customer number and locate the original transaction on the disk and then alter the transaction in accordance with the customer’s new wishes. This transaction revision capability offers unusual benefits in some highly fluid data entry circumstances.




<br />A key-to-disk system is also capable of reserving a sector of the disk for editing routines, for a “menu”, or for training programs. For example, editing routines may be invoked to review all transactions on the disk before they are transferred to the computer system to ensure that all data fields contain the proper type of data and to check that customer and other types of identification numbers entered as parts of transactions are valid. Errors found can then be corrected by entries through the terminals. Another capability is that the CRT can display a format for the type of transaction being processed to assist the operator in filling the proper spaces with data, with reference to direct input transaction terminals.

<br />An advantage of key-to-disk and key-to-tape systems over many other types of data entry systems is that much of the data handling is electronic rather than mechanical. This results in less downtime for the entire system and for each data input station within the system. It also increases the speed with which data can be input and it usually results in a quieter, more work-conducive environment. In most high-activity work situations, key-to-disk and key-to-tape systems are believed to offer 20 to 40 percent faster data entry than electromechanical systems.

 <h2> 7.	Portable Encoding Devices & Other Data Collection Techniques</h2>

<p> Devices like the data loggers are now in common use. These devices often employ magnetic cassettes or cartridges for storage purposes. 

Among other data collection and input techniques is the use of Embossed Plastic Badges.

  <h2> 8.	Direct Data Entry (DDE)</h2>

 <p> A <strong> Direct Data Entry </strong>station consists of a Visual Display Unit with a Keyboard. Data is keyed in by the Operator, checked, displayed on the screen and then entered for processing.

<br /> A DDE station can also be used to interrogate the computer files. The technique is particularly common with the smaller computer systems, but may be used in any configuration.
