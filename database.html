                 <h2> Database</h2>
<p>   A <strong> Database</strong> is a single organized collection of structured data, stored with a minimum of duplication of data items so as to provide a consistent and controlled pool of data. This data is common to all users of the system, but is independent of programs that use the data.
    </p>
                 <hr />

               <h2>  Types of Databases</h2>
  <p>  There are several common types of databases; each type of database has its own data model (how the data is structured). 
                 <br />
      
      They <strong> include;</strong> Flat Model, Hierarchical Model, Relational Model and Network Model. 

      </p>
<hr />

               <h2 > The Flat Model Database</h2>
 <p> In a  <strong> model database,</strong> there is a two dimensional (flat structure) array of data. 
                 For instance, there is one column of information and within this column it is assumed that each data item will be related to the other. For instance, a flat model database includes only zip codes. Within the database, there will only be one column and each new row within that one column will be a new zip code.
     </p>
 <hr />
                 <h2> The Hierarchical Model Database</h2>
 <p>  The <strong> hierarchical model database </strong> resembles a tree like structure, such as how Microsoft Windows organizes folders and files. In a hierarchical model database, each upward link is nested in order to keep data organized in a particular order on a same level list. For instance, a hierarchal database of sales, may list each days sales as a separate file. Within this nested file are all of the sales (same types of data) for the day.

Hierarchical structure: organizes data in a series of levels, hence why it is called hierarchal. Its top to bottom like structure consists of nodes and branches; each child node has branches and is only linked to one higher level parent node.
     </p>

                 <hr />
        <h2 >  The Network Model</h2>
  <p> In a <strong>  network model,</strong> the defining feature is that a record is stored with a link to other records - in effect networked. These networks (or sometimes referred to as pointers) can be a variety of different types of information such as node numbers or even a disk address. 
<br />•	Network structure: Similar to hierarchical, network structures also organizes data using nodes and branches. But, unlike hierarchical, each child node can be linked to multiple, higher parent nodes. 
            </p>
           <hr />

     <h2 >   The Relational Model </h2>
  <p >   The <strong> relational model </strong> is the most popular type of database and an extremely powerful tool, not only to store information, but to access it as well. Relational databases are organized as tables. The beauty of a table is that the information can be accessed or added without reorganizing the tables. A table can have many records and each record can have many fields. 
Tables are sometimes called a relation. For instance, a company can have a database called customer orders, within this database will be several different tables or relations all relating to customer orders. Tables can include customer information (name, address, contact, info, customer number, etc) and other tables (relations) such as orders that the customer previously bought (this can include item number, item description, payment amount, payment method, etc). It should be noted that every record (group of fields) in a relational database has its own --------primary key. A primary key is a unique field that makes it easy to identify a record. 
Relational databases use a program interface called SQL or Standard Query Language.
      <br />            SQL is currently used on practically all relational databases. 
            <br />     Relational databases are extremely easy to customize to fit almost any kind of data storage. You can easily create relations for items that you sell, employees that work for your company, etc.


<br /> •	Relational structure: Unlike network and hierarchical, a relational database organizes its data in a series of related tables. This gives flexibility as relationships between the tables are built. 

      </p>

                 <hr />
              <h2>   A DATABASE HAS FOUR DISTINCT OBJECTIVES:</h2>

<p>  A.	Database should be shared by many different users.
<br />B.	The integrity and oneness of the database must be preserved
<br />C.	The database system should provide for the needs of different users who each have their own processing requirements and data access methods
<br />D.	The database should be capable to meet the future data processing needs of users, not just their current needs.
