                 <h2>TRANSLATORS </h2>
                 <p>
                      <strong> Translators</strong> are programs that are written and supplied by computer manufactures together with machines .Computer programs when written they are in human sensible form hence they is need to translate these programs into machine code i.e. from source program to object program
                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <p>
                  <strong>  The mostly widely used translators used are the:<br /> Compiler, interpreters and, assemblers</strong>
                 </p>

                   <h2 >THE INTERPRETERS:</h2>
   
 <p>This is a translator program which translates and executes its source code in logical sequence as the program is being executed. For example the program has 50 lines, 1 line will be converted into machine form and then executed then line e.t.c. Interpreters are widely used in programming languages based on small computer because they are easier to use than compilers.
     </p>

                 <hr />
  
                <h2> THE COMPILERS </h2>  
  <p> This is a special translator program which translates high level languages into machine language for execution by the computer.
   </p>
 <hr />

                 <h2> SOUCRCE CODE</h2>
<p> These are program instruction written in high level programming languages that must be translated into machine language to be executed by computer.
 </p>
 <hr />

                 <h2> THE ASSEMBLERS  </h2>
  <p> This is a translator program which translate assembly language statement into machine 
  Code .The machine is to generate for each source code instructions and involves mnemonic source code into machine code. 
      </p>
 <hr />
                  <h2> THE OBJECT CODE</h2>
  <p>The process of translating source into machine code is called object code
      </p>
<hr />
  
              <h2  >   THE MACHINE LANGUAGUE </h2>
   <p> It is a programming language consisting of either 1 or 0 of binary codes
       </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>FILE ORGANISATION TERMS AND CONCEPT</h2>


                 

<p>  <strong> computer system organizes data in hierarchy that start with: </strong></p>
<p> <br /> <strong>• BIT</strong>
  <br /><strong> • BYTES </strong>
 <br /> <strong>• FIELD </strong>
 <br />  <strong>• RECORD</strong> 
 <br />  <strong>• FILE </strong>
 <br /> <strong> • DATABASE </strong>
    </p>
<p>A <strong> Bit</strong> represents the smallest unit of data a computer can handle.
 </p>
<p> group of bits is called a<strong> BYTE </strong>represents a single character, which can be a, number or another symbol.
</p>
<p>A <strong> Field</strong> is a group of characters in the word, a group of words, or a complete number, such as persons name or age.
</p>
<p>A <strong> Record</strong> is a group of related fields, such as the student‘s name, the course taking, the date, enrolled.
    </p>
<p>A <strong> File</strong> is a group of records of the same type or related fields.
    </p>
 <p>A <strong> Database</strong> is a group of related files.
     </p>
<p> An <strong> Entity</strong> is a person, place, things or events on which we maintain information. A order is a typical entity in a sales order file, which maintain information on the firm’s sales order.
 </p>
  <p> An <strong> Attribute</strong> is a piece of information describing a particular entity.
      </p>
 <p> A <strong> Key field </strong>is a field in a record that uniquely identifies instances of that record so that it can be retrieved, updated, or sorted.
     </p>
  
 <p><strong >Database management</strong>  is simply the software that permits an organization to centralized data , manage them efficiently , and provide access to the stored data by applications programs .The DBMS acts as an interface between application  programs and the  and the physical data .
 </p>

<p>  <strong> Logical view</strong> is the representation of data as they would appear to an application programmer or end user.
</p>

 <p> <strong> Physical view </strong>is the representation of data as they would actually be organized on the physical storage media.
     </p>
<p> <strong> Data Definition language</strong> the component of database management system that defines each data element as it appears in the database.
    </p>
<p> <strong >Data manipulation language</strong> a language associated with a database management system that end user and programmers use to manipulate data in the database.
 </p>
 <h2 >Structured query language SQL</h2>
<p>The standard data manipulation for rational database management system.
    </p>
<h2> Data dictionary </h2>
 <p> An automated or manual tool for storing and organizing data / information about the data manipulation in database    
</p>
