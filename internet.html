                 <h2>Intranets and Extranets</h2>
                 <p>
                     Organisations are increasingly using intranets and extranets to disseminate information.<br />

(a) An <strong> intranet </strong> is like a mini version of the Internet.
     Organisation members use networked computers to access information held on a
     Server.
             <br />      <strong >  The user interface</strong> is a browser -similar to those used on the Internet. The
     intranet offers access to information on a wide variety of topics, and often Includes
     access to the Internet.<br />

<br />(b) An  <strong> extranet </strong> is an intranet that is:' accessible to authorized outsiders, using a valid
     Username  and password. The user name will have access rights attached. Determining
     which parts of the extranet can be viewed. Extranets are becoming a very popular
     means for business partners to exchange  information

                 <h2>THE INTERNET</h2>
                 <p>The  <strong>  internet </strong>is a global network connecting millions of computers world wide including businesses organisations, entertainment, religion, education, science etc  

<br /> <strong>  The Internet</strong> is the name given to the technology that allows any computer with a
telecommunications link to send and receive information from any other suitably
Equipped  computer.

<br /> <strong> The World Wide Web </strong>is the multimedia element which provides facilities such as full-
Colors  , graphics, sound and video. Web-sites are points within the network created by
Members who wish to provide an information point for searchers to visit and benefit by the provision of information and/or by entering into a transaction.

<br />Most companies now have a Website on the Internet.<strong> A site</strong> is a collection of screens
providing information in text and graphic form, any of which can be viewed simply by
Clicking the appropriate button , word or image on the screen.
</p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Current uses of the Internet</h2>
                 <p>
                     The scope and potential of the Internet are still developing. Its uses already embrace the
following:

<br />(a) Dissemination of information.
<br />(b) Product/service development -through almost instantaneous test marketing.
<br />(c) Transaction processing (electronic commerce or e-commerce) -both business-to-
      business and business-to-consumer (B to B) or (B to C)
<br />(d) Relationship enhancement -between various groups of stakeholders.
<br>(e) Recruitment and job search -involving organisations worldwide.
     Entertainment -including music, humor, art, games and some less wholesome
     Pursuits!
It is estimated that over 40% of households in the Zambia will have Internet access by the end of 2030.

The Internet provides opportunities to organize for and to automate tasks which would
previously have required more costly interaction with the organisation. These have often
called low-touch or zero-touch approaches.

                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Tasks which a website may automate include:</h2>
                 <p>
<br /> <strong> (a) Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQs):</strong> carefully-structured sets of answers can deal
     with many customer interactions.

.<br /> <strong> (b) Status checking:</strong> major service enquiries (Where is my order? When will the engineer
      arrive? What is my bank balance?) can also be automated, replacing high-cost human
      service processes, and also providing the opportunity to proactively offer better      
      service and .new services.

<br /> <strong>(c) Keyword search:</strong> the ability to search provides web users with opportunities to find
     information in large and complex websites.

<br /> <strong >(d) Wizards (interview style interface) and intelligent algorithms:</strong> these can help .
      diagnosis, which is one of the major elements of service support.

<br /> <strong> (e) E-mail and systems to route and track inbound e-mail:</strong> the ability to route and/or to
     provide automatic responses will enable organisations to deal with high volumes of e-
     mail from actual and potential customers.

<br /> <strong>  (f) Bulletin boards:</strong> these enable customers to interact with each other, thus facilitating
     self-activated customer service and also the opportunity for product/service referral.
     Cisco in particular has created communities of Cisco users who help each other -thus
     reducing the service costs for Cisco itself.

<br />   <strong> (g) Call-back buttons:</strong> these enable customers to speak to someone in order to deal with
      and resolve a problem; the more sophisticated systems allow the call-centre operator   
      to know which web pages the users were consulting at the time.

                 <h2>Problems with the Internet </h2>
                 <p>
                  <br />   (i)  To a large extent the Internet has grown organically without any formal organisation.
     There are specific communication rules, but it is not owned by anyone body and there               
     are no clear guidelines on how it should develop.

<br />(ii) The quality of much of the information on  the Internet leaves much to be desired.

<br />(iii) Speed is a major issue. Data only downloads onto the user's PC at the speed of the       
      slowest telecommunications link -downloading data can be a painfully slow   
      procedure.

<br />(iv) So much information and entertainment is available that employers worry that their  
      staff will spend too much time browsing through non-work-related sites. 

<br />(v)  Connecting an information system to the Internet exposes the system to numerous         
      security

                 <h2>INTERNET SECURITY ISSUES</h2>
                 <p>
                     Establishing organizational links to the Internet brings numerous security dangers.
<br />(a) Corruptions such as viruses on a single computer can spread through the network to
     all of the organization’s computer .

 <br />(b) Disaffected employees have much greater potential to do deliberate damage to
       Valuable corporate data or systems because the network could give them access to  
       parts of the system that they are not really authorized to use.

<br />(c) If the organisation is linked to an external network, persons outside the company
     (hackers) may be able to get into the company's internal network, either to steal data   
     or  to damage the system.

<br />(d) Employees may download inaccurate information or imperfect or virus-ridden
     software from an external network: For example 'beta' .(free trial) versions of
     forth coming new editions of many major packages are often available on the     
     Internet, but the whole point about a beta version is that it is not fully tested and may   
     contain bugs that could disrupt an entire system.

<br />(e) Information transmitted from one part of an organisation to another may be
     Intercepted. Data can be 'encrypted' (scrambled) in an attempt to make it
     unintelligible to eavesdroppers, this is covered later in this section.

<br />(f) The communications link itself may break down or distort data. The worldwide
     telecommunications infrastructure is improving thanks to the use of new technologies,
     and there are communications 'protocols' governing the format of data and signals
     transferred.

                 <h2>Hacking</h2>
                 <p>
                     
   <strong>   Hacking</strong> involves attempting to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, usually
through telecommunications links.

Hackers require only limited programming knowledge to cause large amounts of damage. 
The fact that billions of bits of information can be transmitted in bulk over the public
telephone network has made it hard to trace individual hackers, who can therefore make
repeated attempts to invade systems. Hackers, in the past, have mainly been concerned to
copy information, but a recent trend has been their desire to corrupt it.

<br />Phone numbers and passwords can be guessed by hackers using electronic phone
directories or number generators and by software which enables rapid guessing using
hundreds of permutations per minute.

Default passwords are also available on some electronic bulletin boards and sophisticated hackers could even try to 'tap' messages being transmitted along phone wires (the number actually dialed will not be scrambled).

                 </p>

                 <hr />
                 <h2>Virus</h2>
                 <p>
                     A <strong> virus </strong>is a piece of software which infects programs and data and possibly damages them and replicates itself to infect other data and programs on the computer or other computers.

Viruses need an opportunity to spread. The programmers of viruses therefore place viruses in the kind of software which is most likely to be copied. This includes:

<br />(a) Free software (for example from the Internet).
<br />(b) Pirated software (cheaper than original versions).
<br />(c) Games software (wide appeal).
<br />(d) E-mail attachments (often with instruct1ons to send the message on to others).

The problem has been exacerbated by the probability of computers and disks and the
Increased availability and use of e-mail.

Whilst it is possible to disable floppy disk drives to prevent files entering the organisation
Via floppy disk, this can severely disrupt work processes. At the very least, organisations
should ensure all files received via floppy disk and e-mail are virus checked.

Very new viruses may go undetected by anti-virus software (until the anti-virus software
vendor updates their package -and t& organisation installs the update). Two destructive
viruses of recent times are:

<br />•	Melissa -which corrupts Microsoft Office documents
<br />•	Love bug- which attacks the operating system

<br />Viruses can spread via floppy disk, but the most destructive viruses utilizes e-mail links -
traveling as attachments to e-mail messages. When the file attachment is opened or
executed, the virus infects that system. Recent viruses have been programmed to send
Themselves to all addresses in the users electronic address book.

                     </p>

                     <hr />

                <h2> Type of virus </h2> 

             <h2> File viruses</h2> 

                <p> <strong> File viruses</strong> infect program files. When you run an infected  
                                       Program the virus runs first, then passes control to the original  
                                       program. While it has control, the virus code copies itself to     
                                       another file or to another disk, replicating itself.
                 </p>

                <h2> Boot sector</h2>

                 <p > The <strong> boot sector</strong> is the pan of every hard disk and diskette which   
                                       Is viruses read by the computer when it starts up. If the boot 
                                       sector is infected, the virus runs when the machine starts.
                 </p>


               <h2 > Overwriting Virus </h2>

             
                   <p>  An  <strong> overwriting virus</strong> overwrites each file it infects with itself, so  
                             The  program no longer functions. Since this is very easy to spot  
                                       these viruses do not spread very well.
                       </p>

               <h2>  Worms </h2>

                       <p>   A <strong> worm</strong> is a program which spreads (usually) over network
                                       Connections. It does not attach itself to a host program.
                           </p>

               <h2>  Dropper</h2>
                         <p> A <strong> dropper</strong> is a program, not a virus itself, that installs a virosJon   
                                       the PC while performing another function. 
                 </p>

                <h2> Macro viruses</h2>

           <p>   A <strong> macro virus</strong> is a piece of self-replicating code written in an
                                       application's 'macro' language. Many applications have macro
                                       capabilities including all the programs in Microsoft Office. The
                                       distinguishing factor which makes it possible to create a virus   
                                       with a, macro is the existence of auto-execute events. Auto- 
                                       execute events are opening a file, closing a file, and starting an   
                                       application. Once a macro is running it can copy itself to other  
                                       documents, delete files, and create general havoc. Melissa was a   
                                       well publicised macro virus

                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Encryption and other safety measures</h2>
                 <p>
   <strong> Encryption</strong> aims to ensure the security of data during transmission. It involves the
translation of data into secret code. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a
secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it. Unencrypted data is called plain text; encrypted data is referred to as cipher text.

 <br /><strong> Authentication</strong> is a technique of making sure that a message has come from an authorized sender. Authentication involves adding an extra field to a record with the contents of this field derived from the remainder of the record by applying an algorithm that has previously been agreed between the senders and recipients of data.



Systems can have firewalls (which disable part of the telecoms technology) to prevent
Unwelcome intrusions into company system, but a determined hacker may well be able to bypass even these. 

<strong> Dial-back security </strong> operates by requiring the person wanting access to the network to dial into it and identify themselves first. The system then dials the person back oh their
authorized number before allowing them access.

All attempted violations of security should be automatically logged and the log checked
regularly. In a multi-user system, the terminal attempting the violation may be
automatically disconnected.
