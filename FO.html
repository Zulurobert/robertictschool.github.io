<h2>file organization</h2>
                 <p>
                     <strong> File organization </strong> refers to the way in which records are held on a file, with a view to be able to retrieve data information.

“With any file, regardless of the medium used to hold it, some methods are needed by which a record can be located when it is desired to be retrieved.  For this purpose it is necessary to give each record in the file a key field by which it can be identified.  The relationship of the key fields in consecutive or following records is termed the file organization

                 <h2>Serial file organization.</h2>
                 <p>
                     A file has an unordered, or serial, organization if the records are in no particular order or sequence on the file. Transaction files may have an unordered organization.  Note that this is not the same as random organization. Here is a representation of the Serial File Organization. 2, 5, 1, 3, 4.

                 <h2>Sequential (or ordered) file organization.</h2>
                 <p>
                     
A file’s organization is sequential, if the records on the file are in a logical, or consistent sequence according to their key field, for example in alphabetical order, or numerical order. New records must be placed into their correct position in the file, and records, which follow, pushed back to make room for the new records. To add on, it is usually best to leave spaces on sequential files, to allow room for new records. This is done by grouping records together in ‘buckets’, with each bucket starting part-filled with records, and part empty for new additions. After a while, when the empty spaces start to fill up, the file will be given a spring-clean, and records regrouped into new buckets with spaces. This process of tidying up the files is called, housekeeping. Here is a representation of the Ordered or sequential File Organization. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

                 <h2>Random file organization, (R-F-O).</h2>
                 <p>Random file organization is a bit more difficult to understand. When we say that a file has a random organization; we don’t mean that the records are held anywhere on the file. With random organization, records are put on file in one of two ways. These two ways from which one is chosen are:

<br />A: Either in some way that corresponds to a key value, which is calculated 
from data on the record, when it is filed, using some sort of ‘hashing’ or, ‘Randomizing’ technique.

<br />B: Or by means of an index.  When a record is put on file, its key fields are listed sequentially in an index, which shows the address location on the file, where the record is to be placed.  An index on a computer file is similar in principle to an index at the back of a book.  This is called indexed sequential organization. Here is a representation of Random file Organization. 10, 1, 20, 2, 30, 3, 40,	4, 50, 5.

                 <h2>file access</h2>

                 <p>
                     <strong> File access </strong> means locating individual records on the file. The way in which a file can be accessed are the following; serial, sequential, or direct.

</p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Serial access.</h2>
                 <p> <strong> Serial access </strong> is the access of data by reading all records physically until the required record is found. The only way of retrieving records from an unordered or serial file is to start from the first record on the file; then go on to the next record; and the next, and so on; all the way through to the end of the file. This is known as serial access. 

<br />A: With transaction files; using serial access to locate unordered files will often be suitable because every record on the file has to be processed.
<br />B: With master files, using serial access to locate records would be very time consuming and very inefficient. This is because (Master files should never have an unordered file organization!).
</p>
<hr />
                 <h2>Sequential access.</h2>
                 <p> <strong> Sequential file access </strong> , is the access of data by reading all records physically until the required record is found. Sequential access is faster than serial access. Since records on a sequentially organized file are in key field order, once the particular record has been located, there is no need to check serially through the rest of the file, to see if there is another record on file with the same key field number.</p>

                 <hr />
                 <h2>Direct access.</h2>
                 <p>This may be defined as access to backing storage, normally disk storage. Furthermore, direct access has the important facility of allowing direct access, that is, records can be accessed independently of each other. It is thus, suitable for files, being processed in a selective manner, and also for storing programs, and systems software, that are required to be called into main storage at any time during the running of an application program. It is as well, an essential requirement, for on-line processing, or where file-examination facilities are needed.

<br />A: The term  <strong >“indexed sequential access” </strong> is used to describe direct access to Records, that are held sequentially, in a file.  Indexed sequential file access uses an index to locate individual records directly.  Both the records on file, and in the index must be held in sequence, and new records must be placed in their correct position on the file; and as well in their correct place on the index.  Indexed sequential access is often faster than sequential access, because any record can be located by reference to the index, which gives the specific address location on the file.

<br />B: <strong>  Random access </strong>. Random access refers to the retrieval of data from a random-organized file. The method of random access, will depend on the method used to put the records on the file in the first place, whether by calculating a key value from the data on the record, or by reference to an index. Furthermore, random access, especially when used with a powerful computer, and calculating the address location of a record from its key ‘search’ value; can be very fast.
