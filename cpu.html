                 <h2> CPU</h2>
               <p>
                   The <strong> brain</strong> of the computer.  This is located on a circuit board inside the desktop or tower computer case
                 </p>
                 <hr />

                 
                 <h2>	The CENTRAL PROCESSOR which is subdivided into:</h2>
                 <p>
                    <br /> i.	The CONTROL UNIT (CU);
<br />ii.	The ARITHMETIC and LOGIC UNIT (ALU);
<BR />iii.	The MAIN STORE (Primary Stora

                 </p>


                 <p>
                     The arrangement and control of the CPU varies from one computer to another. For example, some computers are controlled by a single processor whereas others may contain a number of processors, each controlling a different operation, e.g. Input/Output. This and other options give rise to the variety of computers that are available today. However, in all cases, the basic concept follows that of the Analytical Engine.

                     FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM
                 </h2>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>The Processor</h2>
                 <p>
                     The TWO components of the CPU that make up a processor are the <strong> Control Unit and the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU).</strong>


                 </p>
                 <hr />
                <h2>  Control unit</h2>
 <p >The control unit is a computer component which interprets instructions from the main storage, issues commands to all the elements of a computer: Input, ALU, main storage, Output and auxilliary storage.
</p>
<hr />
 <h2> Arithmetic & Logical Unit (ALU)</h2>
<p> <strong> This is a component of the CPU whose purpose is to:</strong>
<br />to carry out arithmetic operations on data, e.g. adding two numbers.
<br /> to carry out logical operations on data, e.g. comparing two numbers to find which one is larger than the other.
    </p>
<hr />


 <h2> Main Memory</h2>
    
             <p>   <strong> Memory</strong> refers to integrated circuits that store programs instructions and data that can be retrieved. The memory of a computer is the storage area for programs, along with its data while they are executing.
                 <br /><strong> The purpose of main memory is:</strong>
                 </p>
 <p>  <br />•  to store programs during their execution.
<br /> • to store data is being used by the current program
<br /> • to store the operating system.
</p>
<hr />
   <h2 >  Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
   <p>  <strong>  RAM</strong> is the name given to the integrated circuits, or chips that are used for main memory.
        It is called <strong> “Random access”</strong> because of the fact that any address in memory can be accessed at random, or in no particular order during a work session.
</p>

 <p> <strong> RAM</strong> is not a permanent storage place for information; it is active only when a computer is on.
   <br />   When the computer is turned off, information is deleted from memory. 
Computer memory is measured in Kilobytes (KB), or Megabytes (MB) of information.
      (A <strong> byte</strong> is the amount of storage needed to hold one character). 1 KB = 1024 bytes and 1 MB = 1,048,576 bytes.
</p>
                 <hr />

 <h2>  Speed of processors</h2>
     <p >The speed of processors is measured in Megaherz (MHz)</p>
<hr />

     <h2> What is MHz?</h2>
 <p > It is a unit of measurement named after Heinrich R. Herz, a Germany Physicist, who first detected electromagnetic waves in 1883. 1 Herz (Hz) is equal to 1 cycle per second. Consequently Megaherz is a unit of measurement for indicating the frequency of one million electrical vibration cycles per second. A Gigaherz (GHz) is a unit of measurement for indicating the frequency of one billion electrical vibration cycles per second.

Lets take a computer with the following processor speed: 300 MHz, this means that this computer can process 300 million instructions per second. These days, most processors range from 100MHz to over 2.0 GHz. 
     </p>
<hr />

      <h2> Read Only Memory (ROM)</h2>

 <p> This is the name given to chips that store information or instructions that do not change. For example, ROM is used to store the start up instructions and data used when a computer is first turned on.
 </p>
                 <hr />
     <h2> Other types of ROM</h2>
<p <br />• PROM – Programmable Read Only Memory
   <br />• EPROM – Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory
 <br />• EEPROM – Electrical Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory
 <br />• CD-ROM – Compact Disc Read Only Memory
<br />•  DVD-ROM - Digital Versatile Disc Read Only memory
