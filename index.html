        <h2>INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT)</h2>
        <p>

ICT 
 <strong> (information and communications technology - or technologies)</strong> is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or application, encompassing: radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications. ICT (information and communications technology - or technologies) is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or application, encompassing: radio, television, cellular phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and applications associated with them, such as videoconferencing and distance learning.

        <h2>What is information technology?</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>  Information technology</strong>  is the branch of engineering that deals with computers and telecommunications to retrieve, store, and transmit information. However, information technology can also be defined as the development, implementation, and maintenance of computer hardware and software systems to organize and communicate information electronically. It is abbreviated as I-T.

         <h2>What is technology?</h2>
        <p>
<strong> Technology </strong> is the manner of accomplishing a task, especially using technical processes, methods, or knowledge. To add on, technology is basically anything made by man. For example telephones.
        </p>

        <h2>What is logic?</h2>
        <p> <strong> Logic </strong> refers to a science that deals with modes of reasoning. Furthermore, logic can also be said to be a basic tool for computing.</p>

        <h2>WHAT IS A COMPUTER</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong> computer</strong> is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You probably already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web.
A <strong> computer</strong> is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result based on a program or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed
<br /> <strong> OR A computer </strong> is an electronic device that works under the instructions of stored programs to accept input data, process it, store it, and produce information.

        <h2>COMPUTER SYSTERMS</h2>
        <p>
            <strong> Computer systems</strong> 
            A  <strong> computer system </strong> can be defined as the computer itself, and the peripheral devices needed to operate it. E.g, a mouse.

<br /> <strong> OR </strong>
<br />•	Will include the computer along with any software and peripheral devices that are necessary to make the computer function. Every computer system, for example, requires an operating system.
<br />•	A system of interconnected computers that share a central storage system and various peripheral devices such as a printers, scanners, or routers. Each computer connected to the  but has the ability to communicate with other external devices and computers

        <h2>What is an information system?</h2>
        <p>
            An information system is a system consisting of the network of all communication channels within an organisation. For example, office systems.
        </p>

        <h2>SYSTEM</h2>

        <p>
            •	a group of related hardware units or programs or both, especially when dedicated to a single application.

 <strong> system </strong>is a collection of elements or components that are organized for a common purpose. The word sometimes describes the organization or plan itself (and is similar in meaning to method, as in "I have my own little system") and sometimes describes the parts in the system (as in "computer system").
<br />A group of interdependent items that interact regularly to perform a task.<br /> (2)An established or organized procedure; a method.<br /> (3) A computer system refers to the hardware and software components that run a computer or computers

        <h2>HARDWARE</h2>
        <p>
In information technology, <strong> hardware</strong> is the physical aspect of computers, telecommunications, and other devices. The term arose as a way to distinguish the "box" and the electronic circuitry and components of a computer from the program you put in it to make it do things. The program came to be known as the software.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>SOFTWARE</h2>
        <p>•	the programs and other operating information used by a computer.
<br /> •	<strong> Software </strong> is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to operate computers and related devices.
<br />•	Organized information in the form of operating systems, utilities, programs, and applications that enable computers to work.
 <br />•	Software consists of carefully-organized instructions and code written by programmers in any of various special computer languages. Software is divided commonly into two main categories:
         <br />    (1) <strong> System software </strong>: controls the basic (and invisible to the user) functions of a computer and comes usually preinstalled with the machine. See also BIOS and Operating System.
         <br />    (2) <strong> Application software  </strong>: handles multitudes of common and specialized tasks a user wants to perform, such as accounting, communicating, data processing, word processi
<br />Software is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to operate computers and related devices. (The term hardware describes the physical aspects of computers and related devices.)
<br />Software can be thought of as the variable part of a computer and hardware the invariable part. Software is often divided into application software (programs that do work users are directly interested in) and system software (which includes operating systems and any program that supports application software). The term middleware is sometimes used to describe programming that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software (for example, sending a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of operating system to an application in a computer with a different operating system

        <h2>SYSTEM SOFTWARE</h2>
        <p>
           <strong>  System software </strong> is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications
<br />System software (systems software) is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software. System software can be separated into two different categories, operating systems and utility software
System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications.

        <hr />

        <h2>APPLICATION SOFTWARE</h2>
        <p>
            An  <strong> application program</strong> is a program designed to perform a specific function directly for the user or, in some cases, for another application program. Examples of applications include word processors, database programs, Web browsers, development tools, drawing, paint, image editing programs, and communication programs.
A<br />pplication software is a program or group of programs designed for end users. These programs are divided into two classes: system software and application software. While system software consists of low-level programs that interact with computers at a basic level, application software resides above system software and includes database
