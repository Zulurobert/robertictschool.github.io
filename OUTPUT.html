               <h2 > Output Device</h2>
               <p> An Output Device is a piece of hardware that accepts data and programs from the computer. Output devices convert strings of computer bits back into natural-language form to make them understandable to humans. These devices present output on screen displays, on paper or film, and in other forms. Printers and monitors specialise in output. Output devices produce results in either hard-copy or soft-copy form.

<br /> <strong> Hard copy </strong>refers to a permanent form of computer system output – for example, information printed onto an easily portable medium such as paper or film. Printed reports and output put into slide or transparency form are common examples.

<br /> <strong> Soft copy</strong> refers to a nonpermanent form of computer system output – for example, a screen display output that appears temporarily in a form with limited portability.
</p>

   <h2> 1.	Display Devices:</h2>

 <p>  A <strong > display device</strong> is an output device that contains a viewing screen on which it presents computer system output, often resembling a television set. Most display devices fall into one of the two categories: monitors and display terminals.

 <br>  <strong> i.	A Monitor</strong> is a display device without a keyboard. It is the type of display most people have on their PCs, which is limited to a viewing screen.

<br /><strong> ii.	A Display Terminal </strong>is found on many large business networks. It is a communications workstation that includes a screen (for output) and an attached keyboard (for input).

<br />On all display devices, as each key on a keyboard is tapped, the corresponding character representation of the key appears on a display screen at the cursor position. The cursor or insertion point as it is called in some contexts is a highlighted symbol on the screen that indicates where the operator input will be placed. Alternatively, the cursor may point to an option that the user can select.

<br />Display devices are handy when the user requires only small amounts of output and has to see what is being sent as input to the computer system.
	</p>
	<hr />

	<h2> CRT DISPLAY DEVICES:</h2>

<p> <strong> Cathode-ray tube (CRT)</strong> is a display device that projects images on a long-necked display tube similar to that in a television set. Monitors for most desktop systems project images on large picture-tube elements similar to those inside standard TV sets. CRT technology is relatively mature, and over the years, CRTs have become very inexpensive and have gained capabilities for excellent colour output. These features notwithstanding, CRTs are bulky and fragile, and they consume a great deal of power.
</p>
<hr />

  <h2 > FLAT-PANEL DISPLAY DEVICES:</h2>

 <p> These are slim-profile display devices. This class of display devices form images by manipulating charged chemicals or gases sandwiched between panes of glass instead of firing a bulky electron gun. Flat-panel displays are compact, lightweight, and require little power. Because of these features, they are commonly found on notebook and pen-based computers and in a variety of other products.

 <br /> Flat-panel displays on portable computers often use <strong>  liquid crystal display (LCD) </strong>technology. LCD displays light up charged liquid crystals, and special colour filters manipulate this light to paint the screen. LCD is the most common type of flat-panel-display technology in use. The major advantages of LCDs over CRTs are low power consumption, portability, and compact size. LCDs also do not emit any electromagnetic radiation. However, LCDs also cost more than CRTs; what’s more, their screens may provide less contrast with more glare and poorer resolution. 

Many notebook computers use either active-matrix or passive-matrix colour-display technology. Active-matrix displays provide much sharper screen images than passive-matrix screens, but they provide this benefit at a higher cost.
</p>
<hr />
      <h2> GRAPHICS  STANDARDS:</h2>

 <p>* The earliest display devices were strictly character addressable; that is, they could display only certain text characters in limited sizes as output. As demand grew for devices with graphics capabilities, manufacturers developed displays capable of more complex output.

<br />Almost all monitors sold with PCs today generate screen images through a technique called <strong> bit mapping.</strong> 
    <br /> <strong> Bit mapping</strong> is a graphical output technique in which software individually controls each pixel element in a screen image. Thus, the computer can create virtually any type of image on the screen.
    <br />  A <strong> pixel</strong> is a single dot on a display screen. Monitors sold today can output text in a variety of sizes, complex graphics images, and moving video sequences.

Computer graphics standards specify several modes in which a display device can operate. For example, a<strong > VGA display (for video graphics array)</strong> – the standard for many 386 and 486 computers with 14-inch and 15-inch displays – uses a maximum resolution of 640 by 480 pixels. VGA allows a screen to display at most 256 colours simultaneously.

<br />  The <strong> SVGA standard (for super VGA)</strong> took over when Pentium computers and 17-inch monitors became popular. It allows even larger pixel matrices. SVGA monitors often display at resolutions of either 800 by 600 pixels or 1,024 by 768 pixels and feature up to 16,777,216 colours. An SVGA monitor can display 2.5 times as much information as a VGA monitor of the same size. A major drawback to displaying at fine resolutions is that characters are minimally readable on a 14- or 15-inch display and often unreadable on a laptop screen. Two other drawbacks are speed – because there is more information to paint on a high-resolution screen, the screen takes longer to rewrite every time it is changed, and the greater memory required.

                 <h2>i.	Speakers:</h2>

                 

<p >These are output devices
that produce sound. Most computer systems sold today, especially for home use,
come with a set of speakers. Speakers provide audio output for such
consumer-oriented multimedia applications as playing computer games, listening
to background music on CD and watching television in an onscreen window. Common
business applications include video demonstrations and presentations as well as
videoconferencing. As more and more computer systems include sound
capabilities, increasing numbers of applications are integrating sound
components.</p>
<hr />
                 <h2>ii.	Graphics Printers:</h2>

                 

<p>A plotter is an output
device that is designed primarily to produce charts, graphs, diagrams,
drawings, maps, three-dimensional illustrations and other forms of hard copy.
Graph plotters are required for high quality diagrams. The graph plotter
consists of a pen that can be located, under program control, over any point on
a sheet of paper. Commands exist to lower or raise the pen, so that any
required drawing can be automatically produced. Positioning information is
provided by the computer in the form of X/Y co-ordinates. A separate motor
controls the movement of the pen along each axis. The unit of movement is an
increment; the basic size of an increment can be as small as a few thousandths
of an inch.</p>

<p>Plotters work by a
variety of technologies. There are two basic types of graph plotters of which,
the two most common types in use today are ink-jet plotters of the drum
plotters’ family and electrostatic plotters of the flat bed plotters’ family:</p>

                 <h2>iii.	Voice-Output Devices:</h2>
               <p>  These are pieces of hardware that play back or imitate human speech.
                 
                    For a number of years, computers have been able to communicate with users, after a fashion, by imitating human speech. Voice-output devices, the machines responsible for such messages, convert stored digital data into spoken messages
             </p>
                 <h2>iv.	Film Recorders:</h2>
                 <p>
                     These are devices that convert computer output to film. Film recorders convert high-resolution, computer-generated images directly into slides, transparencies and other film media. Just a few years ago film recorders served only large computer systems, through such applications as art, medical imaging and scientific work. Today, they connect to PCs and are used for such applications as making slides for meetings and client presentations. Today, computer-generated slides account for a large percentage of all business slides made.

Film recorders, like cameras, are “dumb” devices that do not recognise images in order to record them. Film recorders can transfer onto film virtually any image that can be captured on a display screen.

                 <h2>v.	Computer Output Microfilm (COM):</h2>
                 <p>
                  <strong  > Computer Output Microfilm</strong> is a system for reducing computer output to microscopic form and storing it on photosensitive film.
                      A computer output microfilm (COM) system places computer output on microfilm media, typically either a  <strong> microfilm reel or microfiche card. </strong>
                 <br />    Both Microfilm and Microfiche are data output media based on a photography technology. Thus, computer output to microfilm is possible in two forms:


                 </p>
               <h2 > (a)	Microfilm Reel:</h2>

<p> <strong>   Microfilm </strong>consists of long filmstrips and looks like rolled-up camera film. Microfilm is not strictly a computer output medium, but is produced as an off-line process. However, a computer is required to assemble and edit the information and write it onto magnetic tape as part of the COM process.

Much commercial computer printed output presents a handling and storage problem, and COM has been developed to help solve this problem.

When the film has been developed it can be stored in a microfilm library until required. A user can access the stored information by placing the film in a standard microfilm reader, which projects an enlarged image onto a screen. Most motor spares organisations now keep their parts catalogues on microfilm, and Building Societies are using the same medium to record account balances.

A COM recorder is a device that accepts standard digital information from a computer, transforms it into readable characters and records it onto microfilm at a very high speed of up to half a million characters per second. The use of microfilm provides high-density inexpensive recording and small size for ease of handling and speed of retrieval.
    </p>
                 <br />

<h2 >(b)	Microfiche Card:</h2>

<p> Output is also made to microfiche card. A  <strong> microfiche card</strong> is about the size of a standard punched card (four-by-six-inch card). Each can contain the equivalent of 270 A4 pages of printed information. They can be created in the same way as microfilm or each page of information can be separately imposed on the fiche. Basically the Microfiche is the same film medium as that used in Microfilm but cut into small, flat rectangles, typically from 2 by 4 inch to about 4 by 6 inch.

Photoreduced data can be entered on microfiche in such small size that the entire St. James version of the Bible has been recorded on one microfiche measuring about 2.5 by 3.5 inch. This diminutive size is important when the quantity of data stored is massive and storage space is at a premium.

The great disadvantage is that microfiche cannot be directly read by a computer or by the human eye. To be read by a computer, the microfiche must be output in a stylised font compatible with MICR or OCR devices; then a special microfiche copying device must convert the microfiche to paper copy, which an MICR or OCR machine finally reads. This arrangement is awkward at best and is seldom encountered in practice. 
    </p>
                 <hr />

	<h2> Advantages of COM devices:></h2>

<p> <br />The advantages of microfilm and microfiche are their compactness and low cost.
              <br />    Microfilming can result in tremendous savings in paper costs, storage space, mailing and handling. 
    </p>
                 <hr />
<h2> Disadvantages of COM devices:</h2>

 <p> For human perusal, microfilm and microfiche retrieved from storage must be placed on a special reader and magnified hundreds of times. If copies in human-readable form are desired, some readers can produce printed copies from the magnified image on the reader.

Because of the limitations of microfilm and microfiche, their primary use is for encoding information that either is for archival purposes or must be referenced only occasionally and for which it seems unlikely that hard copy will ever be desired. COM technology is useful for organisations that must keep massive files of information that they need not update. It’s also useful for organisations that need to manipulate large amounts of data but find online access to a computer system impractical or too costly. Libraries also often record certain infrequently used journals and books on microfilm so that these bulky items need not take up library shelf space.

In recent years however, as optical disks have gained in popularity, COM systems have faced serious challenges to the near monopoly they once held on archival document storage and retrieval.
 </p>
  <h2>  vi.	Visual Display Units (VDUs):</h2>

<p > A <strong> VDU </strong>is the screen of a terminal on which computer output is displayed during interactive communication.  The VDU is a keyboard terminal. 
It is designed for interactive applications, but uses a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) instead of a printer to display input and output messages. This type of terminal benefits the user who requires increased speed, silence and convenience. A small matrix printer is often used with a VDU to provide a hard-copy facility.

<br />A VDU consists of a keyboard for manual input of characters and a screen, which displays the characters held in the terminal’s character store. Electronic circuits control the display of the characters, the editing of data held in the store and the interface between the terminal and the transmission line. A VDU, which has all these components in one self-contained unit, is called a STAND-ALONE terminal.

There are two methods of transmission. In the first, each character is transmitted to the computer as it is entered. In the second, the characters are keyed into the memory of the VDU and then, on depression of the “End of Message” (Send; Transmit) key, the entire contents of memory, or selected parts, are transmitted to the computer. This allows several VDUs to share a single transmission line efficiently.
    </p>
  <h2>  vii.	Facsimile (FAX):</h2>

 <p> <strong >  Facsimile or fax</strong> is a method for transmitting text documents, pictures, maps, diagrams and the like over the phone lines.  It is an Input/Output or transmitter/receiver device that has become a standard office equipment. Early implementations consisted of one fax machine transmitting images to another using telephone lines as a medium. Today, fax machines are also attached as terminals to a processor, which is used to store and forward fax images. In this capacity the processor is used as a repository of fax images, which can be distributed to a variety of devices such as other fax machines, terminals and laser printers. 

<br />Facsimile technology resembles e-mail, except it employs different methods and it can be more convenient or less convenient for certain types of uses.

<br />Fax machines make it possible for hard-copy images of documents to be sent from one location to another over ordinary phone lines. For example, a Secretary in Kabwe may place a short document containing both text and pictures into a fax machine. The fax machine digitises the page images and transmits the resulting data over the phone lines to Lusaka and Kitwe. In Lusaka, another fax machine receives the electronic page images and reproduces them in hard-copy form. In Kitwe, a PCs hard disk picks up the fax image in soft-copy form for later viewing on a display screen. All of this data exchange may take place in less than a minute.

<br />PCs need fax modems and fax software to communicate with both fax machines and other computers with faxing capabilities. Fax modems and fax software make it possible for PCs to communicate with both fax machines and other PCs with faxing capabilities. Computer-to-computer faxing brings certain advantages, including saving paper, preventing time lost waiting in line for the office fax machine, and allowing recipients to electronically save and modify faxed documents and to route them elsewhere. Faxing capabilities are often integrated with other mail and messaging technologies. For instance, e-mail-to-fax software lets users turn their e-mail messages into faxes.
