                 <h2>generations of programming languages.</h2>
                 <p>
                     
A computer can only process data and instructions that are in binary format.  For a computer to be able to carry out instructions in a piece of software, those instructions must be in that particular computer’s own machine code language.  
Machine code programs are tedious and difficult to produce, and can only run on the specific type of machine for which they are written.
To overcome these problems, most software’s are written in more programmer friendly languages. These programs are then translated into machine code using specialized translating software’s such as compilers, assemblers and interpreters.
You should note that, all other languages other than machine code, are said to be high level or low level languages according to how closely they can be said to resemble machine code.

                 <h2> generation of languages.</h2>
                 <p>
                     1: <strong> first generation language; </strong> year, 1950-60; level, machine language; examples of machine language are, user code, and machine code; main features. They use binary digits of ones and zeros, they are machine oriented, and they are awkward to write.

<br />2:<strong> second generation language; </strong> year, 1960-70; level, low level or assembly language; examples of assembly languages are, assembler and user code; main features; use mnemonics or symbols, are machine oriented or dedicated.

<br />3: <strong> third generation language;></strong>  year, 1970-80; level, high level programming language or problem oriented languages; examples of problem oriented languages are, visual basic, Pascal, Cobol, dbase 5 and Fortran; main feature’s, there is extensive use of vocabulary, one statement can produce numerous instruction codes, they are problem oriented rather than machine oriented, and a set of rules such as, “if” “then” “else” “while” “do while”, etc, must be obeyed.

<br />4: <strong> fourth generation language;  </strong>year, 1980-90; level, high level language or procedural language; examples of procedural languages are, visual basic, Pascal, dbase 3, 4 and 5; main features, involves the writing of procedures, instead of writing a program with the same piece of code or visual programming language appearing several times, it adds in procedures, hence reducing the amount of coding. Note that coding is a system of symbols, numbers, or signals that convey information to a computer.
Let us look at another fourth generation language. year, 1990-2000; level, high level language or non procedural languages; examples of non procedural languages are, Microsoft access query language and structured query language.

<br />5: <strong> fifth generation language; </strong> year, 2000-upwards; level, object oriented languages; examples of object oriented languages are, java, Smalltalk and lisp; main features, objects, members and classes summarize inheritance and the use of re-usable components.

<br />Another level of language is <strong> natural language </strong>. However, this is still in its early years and its features are yet to be defined.

                 </p>

                 <hr />
                 <h2>low level languages.</h2>
                 <p>
                     These are computer programming languages that are closer to machine language than they are to human language. Low-level languages have the advantage that they can be written to take advantage of anything in the central processing unit which is the "brain" of any computer. 
Thus, a program written in a low-level language can be extremely efficient, making the best use of both the computer memory and processing time. However, to write a low-level program you must do the following.
<br />1: Take a substantial amount of time, as well as a clear understanding of the inner workings of the processor itself. 
<br />2: Low-level programming is typically used only for very small programs, or for parts of coding that are highly critical and must run as efficiently as possible. Note, that coding is a system of symbols, numbers signals that convey information to a computer.
Furthermore, if well written, a low level language program will be efficient and fast, although there are a number of disadvantages:
<br />1: The programmer requires a detailed knowledge of the computer’s structural design and the way that it carries out operations.
<br />2: The programs can only operate on the type of machine for which they are written-they are non-portable.
<br />3: Programming is lengthy and tedious. Even a seemingly simple process such as adding two numbers together may require several actions.
<br />4: Programs are difficult to understand once they have been written.

                 <h2>high level languages</h2>

                 <p>
                     <strong> High level languages </strong>  are computer programming languages that resemble natural or human language and are designed to reflect the requirements of a problem.  Human language is the way which people express themselves most naturally, yet it is usually not precise enough to define a program for a computer.  A statement such as ‘I want ham and eggs or beans on toast’ will define a requirement sufficiently enough for a human to be able to interpret it, but is too confusing for a computer to understand whether the person wants a choice between ‘ham and eggs’ or beans on toast’?, or whether they want a choice between ‘ham and eggs on toast or ‘ham and beans on toast’.
High level languages are designed to be easy for people to be able to learn, but with precise grammar and language rules that allow programs to be able to define them clearly.

                 </p>
                 <hr />

                 <h2>characteristics or features of high level languages.</h2>
                 <p>
<br />1: <strong> They are Problem oriented. </strong> Meaning the language is designed to make programming as easy as possible. Some high-level languages are quite specialized, for example, FORTRAN is designed for mathematical, and scientific analysis.

<br />2: <strong> They are written in Macro instructions.</strong> Meaning the source program is completely written in macro instructions. To add on, a single ‘macro’ in the source program, may generate dozens of instructions in the object program.  Macro-instructions are often called statements.

<br />3:<strong>  They are Machine independent.</strong> Meaning, programs written in high-level languages, can often be used on several computers, for which, appropriate compilers, or interpreters exist, although, minor changes will often be needed, to allow for different input, and output conventions.

<br />4: <strong> It has a rigid syntax.</strong> Rigid, means not flexible. Syntax on the other hand means grammar, or language rules. Rigid syntax, therefore, could mean it has firm grammar, or unbendable language rules.
This said let us now look at Rigid Syntax. A source program has to follow a prescribed, or set form, and departures from it, will be detected, during compilation, or interpretation, and reported as errors. Note that, Structured programming, normally involves the division of the program, into sub-routines. These sub-routines can be developed, and in some cases observed, independently of each other, and of the main program; and should ensure that the overall reason of the program, is considered from the start. The three constructs, or concepts that characterize, or describe structured programming are:
<br />A: <strong> Sequence. </strong> These are a set of actions performed in a sequence. Furthermore, in a sequence structure, one action, or event leads to the next ordered action in a predetermined order, no actions can be skipped in this sequence.

<br />B: <strong> Selection. </strong> In a selection structure, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program takes one of the two courses of action, after which, the program moves on to the next event. The structure is sometimes referred to as an “if-then-else” structure, because it directs the program to perform in this way. 

<br />C: <strong> Iteration; </strong> this is the act of repeating a process; usually with the aim of approaching a desired result. These are also known as loop structures. In a loop structure, the program asks a question, and if the answer requires an action, it is performed, and the original question is asked again, until the answer is such that, the action is no longer required. For example, a program written to compute a company’s weekly payroll for each individual employee will begin by computing the wages of one employee, and continue performing the action in a loop, until there are no more employee wages to be computed; and only then will the program move on to the next action. They contain loops, but with one exit point only. It uses commands such as: REPEAT, UNTIL, or WHILE, END.

<br />5: <strong> They have their own program development environment.</strong> Many high-level languages, now have their own environment, for the development of programs, including editors, which aid the writing of program text; and may interact with the compiler, or interpreter, so that errors can be identified, and corrected as easily as possible.  For example, Visual basic.

                 <h2>Low level languages:</h2>
                 <p>
                     A <strong >low-level language</strong> corresponds closely, or writes almost similar to machine code, so that, a single low-level language instruction, translates to a single machine-language instruction. Examples include an Assembler, and User Code, and machine code.  Mnemonic are used, instead of binary digits. Furthermore, symbolic addresses are used. In addition, the process, was still time consuming but not as much as machine languages

                 <h2>High level languages:</h2>
                 <p>
                     A <strong >high-level language</strong> instruction typically translates into a series of machine-language instructions. The code was written in ‘structured English’, and hence the program now would be easier to change, than re-write. To add on, high-level languages, allow faster development of large programs. However, the final program executed by the computer, is not as efficient, but the saving in programmer time, generally by far outweighs, the shortfall of the finished product. Furthermore, high level languages, are machine independent, and are problem solving languages; and are a greater advance, over mnemonics. Examples include, COBOL, Pascal, visual basic, etc.
                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Machine code:</h2>
                 <p>
                     These are instructions in a form that a computer can understand. They are also sometimes, the result of the compilation of a high level source program.  The only digits used are, the binary digits of 1 and 0. Furthermore, this was the first type of language, and all machine operation codes, had to be in binary 1, and 0, to represent the instructions.
To add on, each variable, or storage location, had to have a unique address; and instructions had to be written in the correct sequence. It was easier to re-write programs than amend them.
Also, the process was time consuming, and inefficient.

                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Assembly languages:</h2>
                 <p>
                    Each computer manufacturer normally develops a low-level language, that corresponds closely to the particular machine languages, used by that manufacturer. Furthermore, to allow this program to run, the manufacturer will provide a program called an assembler, which will translate the assembly language into machine code. Examples of assembly language include, Assembler, and User Code.
 

                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Problem orientated languages:</h2>
                 <p>
                     These are high-level languages, which are intended to be machine independent, and reflect the type of problem to be solved, rather than the features of the machine. To add on, the source programs are more similar to the English language. Examples or problem oriented languages include, COBOL, visual basic, FORTRAN, etc.
                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Procedural languages:</h2>
                 <p>
                     Instead of writing programs with the same piece of coding appearing numerous times, they are allowed, the joining of procedures into the program, therefore reducing the amount of coding. They as well enable programs to call procedures, and to pass limitations.
                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Non-procedural language:</h2>
                 <p>
                     These are languages that, allow the programmer to describe what is required to be done, rather than how it is done. Examples include, structured query language and Microsoft query ACCESS.
Instead of telling the machine how to solve a problem, the user tells the machine what is required. For example, by using the query option in Microsoft Access.
