                 <h2> Types of computers. (Digital, analogue, and hybrid).</h2>
                 <p>
                     1: <strong>  Digital computers;</strong> This is a computer that represents information by numerical, or binary digits, or by discrete values such as 1, 2, 3, this is done by operating on it in steps. Discrete values occur at each step in the operation. Counting on ones fingers is probably the simplest digital operation we all know. Furthermore, digital watches have special, tiny, digital computers within them.

<br />2: <strong> Analog computers;</strong> This is a computer that is similar to measuring instruments such as a thermometer, voltmeter, and wrist watches with pointers on a circular disc; or a computer that represents information in changing quantities. To add on, they process data in electrical voltages which are like changeable positions of a pointer on dial. The output from analog computers is often in the form of smooth graphs, from which information can be read.

<br />3:<strong> Hybrid computers;></strong> These are computers that have the combined features of both analogue, and digital computers. However, digital computers are the mostly used.

                 <h2>Classification of digital computers.</h2>
                 <p>
1: <strong>  Mainframe computers:</strong> mainframe computers are large general purpose computers with extensive processing, storage, and input and output capabilities. The market for these computers is dominated by IBM.

<br />2: <strong> Mini computers:</strong> mini computers are physically smaller compared to a mainframe computer. They are used for special purposes, or smaller scale general purpose work. However, more recently, a mini computer is thought of in terms of been a server that is part of a larger network.

<br />3: <strong> Micro computers;</strong> A micro computer, is a computer with a micro processor as its central processing unit. There rapid technological development has had a major effect on the whole computer industry over the past twenty years or so. Examples are P-C's, Apple Macintoshes, DELLs, COMPACs, etc.
We should also note that, microcomputers in the form of P-C’s vastly outnumber minicomputers and mainframes.

<br />4: <strong> laptop computers;</strong> A laptop computer is a P-C, which is sufficiently small, and light, so as to allow the user to use it comfortably on their lap. A typical laptop computer operates on the supply of electricity from the main, or uses rechargeable batteries, and is as well small enough to fit in a brief case, and yet still leave room for other items. They normally have in built disk drives, and flat screens. The outside are commonly LCD's, which are also known as liquid crystal displays.

<br />5: <strong> Notebook computers:</strong> A notebook computer is a small compact portable computer. To add on, just like a computer, it too can be powered either by batteries, or by an electrical supply from the main. It is sometimes called a laptop and generally costs more than a desktop computer.

<br />6: <strong> Palm-tops:</strong> This is a type of computer small enough to hold in one hand, and operate with the other. To add on, because of their small size, most palmtop computers do not include disk drives. It is as well sometimes known as a hand-top computer. In addition, it has a small screen, and a compressed keyboard.

<br />7:  <strong>  Super computers:</strong> A super computer, is a computer that performs at the currently highest operational rate for computers. To add on, super computers have high

                 <h2>The other classification of computers we will give are purpose computers. Namely, general purpose, and special purpose computers.</h2>
                 <p>
<br />A: <strong> General purpose computers: </strong> General purpose computers, are computers that follow instructions, hence virtually all computers from micro to mainframe, are general purpose computers. They are as well designed to solve a wide range of problems.

<br />B:,<strong> Special purpose computers:</strong> A special purpose computer is a computer that is designed from scratch, to perform a specific function. They are as well designed to solve a narrow range of problems. An example of a special purpose computer is, a word processor computer.

                 <hr />

                 <h2>Types of purpose computers.</h2>
                 <p>
                     1:<strong> A word processor;</strong> It is a special purpose computer used in the production of office documents, letters, contracts and much more. You should note that general purpose computer can run as a word processing program and hence temporarily become a special purpose computer.

<br />2: <strong> A home computer;</strong> This is a low cost micro computer of limited capability, and designed for domestic use with programs such as those typically used for things like computer games, or controlling family finances.

<br />3: <strong> A personal computer;</strong> It is also known as a P-C.as mentioned earlier, it is microcomputer designed for independent use by an individual either at work or at home, and mainly for business purposes. Some P-C's are portable and can be connected to a mini computer, or a main frame computer so as to allow the user gain access to facilities offered by the larger machine.

<br />4:<strong>  A desktop computer;</strong> This is any computer designed for use on a desk in an office environment. Therefore, home computers and P-C's are desktop computers.

<br /> <strong> An embedded,</strong> or set in computer; This is one that is within some other device or system but is not accessed directly. For example, there are embedded computers operating in watches, cameras, video recorders and many other types of domestic and industrial equipment.
